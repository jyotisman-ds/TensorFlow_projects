- ### [Beans Classifier](https://github.com/jyotisman-ds/TensorFlow_projects/blob/main/Beans_fullCalssifier.ipynb)

    - Model Demo : This model learns the Beans images dataset from tensorflow datasets. The images are fed into an augmentation pipeline before being channeled through a tf.data pipeline.

    - Overview : The trained model is deployed on to the browser using tensorflow.js. It can take a picture of a bean leaf and predict whether it belongs to one of the two diseased categories - bean_rust or angular leaf spot or id its healthy.   

    _Tools : Python, Tensorflow, Keras, Tensorflow_datasets, Tensorflow.js, html, javascript, Matplotlib
